## SCX Tryptic Peptide Sample Cleanup
### Solutions:
- Ethyl Acetate
- SPE Load Buffer: 80% Acetonitrile, 1.0% Formic Acid
- SPE Wash Buffer: 10% Acetonitrile, 0.2% Formic Acid
- SPE Elution Buffer: 70% Acetonitrile, 5% Ammonium Hydroxide *(__IMPORTANT__ - Must be made up fresh!)*

### Sample considerations:
- Components of the sample must not inhibit the enzymatic activity Trypsin.
- The sample may contain detergents or polymers that are uncharged or negatively charged.
- SDC is used to denature the proteins and enhance the activity of Trypsin.
- SDC precipitates in acidic conditions.  If using TCEP the pH of this solution must be neutralized before adding it to the reaction.
- Calcium causes SDC to precipitate.

### Solid phase extraction - peptide cleanup:
1. Add 500ul SPE Load Buffer to the digested sample. (10x the volume of the digest volume)
2. Mix by pipetting up and down and transfer to a p1000 pipet tip packed with 1 or more 2mm diameter discs of CDS Empore SCX or use Waters MCX products.
3. Spin the liquid through the tip at an adequate g-force until dry.  This takes a few minutes.
4. Wash with 500ul of SPE Load Buffer.  Spin until dry.
5. Wash with 500ul of SPE Wash Buffer.  Spin until dry.
6. Elute bound peptides with 150ul of SPE Elution Buffer directly into injection vials or other tubes.
7. Evaporate to dryness in a centrifugal vacuum concentrator such as a speed-vac.
8. Dissolve peptides in injection solvent appropriate for your LC/MS system.
