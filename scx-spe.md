## SCX Tryptic Peptide Sample Cleanup
### Materials and Solutions:
- Ethyl Acetate
- SPE Load Buffer: 80% Acetonitrile, 1.0% Formic Acid
- SPE Wash Buffer: 10% Acetonitrile, 0.2% Formic Acid
- SPE Elution Buffer: 70% Acetonitrile, 5% Ammonium Hydroxide *(__IMPORTANT__ - Must be made up fresh!)*
- Empore Cation solid phase extraction discs (CDS Cat. No. 2251.
  Premade tips are also available. https://www.cdsanalytical.com/empore)
- Dermal Biopsy Punch 2mm with plunger (Miltex Integra Cat. No. 33-31-P/25)
- P1000 pipet tips (Sartorious Cat. No. 791000)
- 15ml receiver tubes (Falcon Cat. No. 352059)
- Spin adapter collars to hold tips at top of receiver tube.

### Sample considerations:
- The sample may contain detergents or polymers that are uncharged or negatively charged.
- The sample should be diluted so the ionic strength is below 10mM.
- Some detergents are difficult to remove such as the Triton series.  Larger wash volumes and inclusion of ethyl acetate washes remove the detergents down to trace levels.  

### Solid phase extraction - peptide cleanup:
1. Pack a P1000 pipet tip with 2 x 2mm diameter Empore Cation discs cut out using a 2mm diameter dermal biopsy punch. Pushing the plunger then letting the release snap up causes the discs to drop down.  Using a suitable small diameter rod push the discs down to the tip until they are compacted neatly. The pipet tip oriface should be small enough to retain the discs at the g-force needed to pass the liquids through the packed bed.  Two 2mm discs should be enough SCX material to bind up to ~30ug of peptides.
2. Add 500ul SPE Load Buffer to the packed P1000 tip. (10x the volume of the digest volume. In this case 50ul was the digest volume.)
3. Pipet the tryptic peptides into the tip and mix by pipetting up and down vigorously.
4. Spin the liquid through the tip at an adequate g-force until dry.  This takes a few minutes
5. Add 500ul of ethyl acetate and spin dry.
6. Add 500ul of SPE Load Buffer and spin dry.
- Additional washes of ethyl acetate and SPE Load Buffer can be used to ensure "complete" detergent removal.  Take care not to allow the P1000 tip to contact any solvent in the collection tube.
7. Add 500ul of SPE Wash Buffer and spin dry.
8. Elute bound peptides with 100ul of SPE Elution Buffer directly into injection vials or other tubes.
- This can be accomplished using manual air pressure using a 5- or 10ml syringe fitted with silicone tubing of a size that will seal inside the top of the P1000.
Alternately, the elution solvent can be spun through the tips into injection vials that are placed into clean receiver tubes after carefully directing the P1000 tip into the center of the injection vial and applying centrifugal force.
9. Evaporate eluted peptides to dryness in a centrifugal vacuum concentrator such as a speed-vac.
10. Dissolve peptides in injection solvent appropriate for your LC/MS system.
