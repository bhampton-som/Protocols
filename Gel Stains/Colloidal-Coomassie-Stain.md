### Reagents and example supplier information:
- Aluminum Sulfate-(14-18)-hydrate (Sigma Cat. No. 368458-500G)
- Coomassie Blue G-250 (BioRad Cat. No. 161-0406
- Ethanol, 95% (e.g. Pharmco-AAPER Cat. No. 111000190 - *not denatured alcohol*)
- Phosphoric Acid, 85% (JT Baker, Cat. No. 0260-02)
- 18mOHM purified water

### Colloidal Coomassie solution:	
- 5% aluminum sulfate-(14-18)-hydrate
- 10% ethanol
- 0.02% Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250
- 2% phosphoric acid (85%)

### Destain solution:
- 5% Ethanol
- 2% Phosphoric Acid

### Prepare the staining solution:
**Important: The order of addition of the components of the stain in the below procedure must be strictly adhered to.
Do Not filter the solution.  Particulates are critical for optimum staining sensitivity.**

1. Dissolve 100g aluminum sulfate-(14-18)-hydrate in ~1500mls of purified water.
2. Add 200mls of ethanol stir to mix.
3. Add 0.4g Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 to the solution.  *Stir until CBB G-250 is dissolved.*
3. Add 47mls of phosphoric acid (the addition of the acid to the alcoholic media lets the Coomassie molecules aggregate into their colloidal state).
4. Bring to final volume of 2000mls with Milli-Q water.


### SDS-PAGE staining procedure:
1. Rinse the gel in purified water 3-times for 10min each on an a shaker or rocker.
2. Stir/shake the bottle of Colloidal Coomassie Stain to suspend all particles.
3. After the final water wash add enough stirred stain solution to completely cover the gel, allowing it to move freely in the gel box.
4. Allow the gel to stain for up to 2hrs, or overnight.
5. Remove the stain and wash 2-times with purified water for 10min.
6. Add a sufficient quantity of destaining solution to allow free movement of the gel in the staining box.
7. Change the destain solution as needed.  *One can also bunch up a "kim wipe" and put it into a corner of the gel staining box during the destaining step to adsorb the stain.  This will allow fewer changes of the destain solution.*
8. Once the gel is sufficiently destained it can be washed with several changes of purified water and then imaged.
