Reagents:

Coomassie solution:	Final Volume to 2000 ml H2O
0.02 % (w/v)	CBB G-250	0,4 g
5 % (w/v)	aluminum sulfate-(14-18)-hydrate	100 g
10 % (v/v)	ethanol (96%)	200 ml
2 % (v/v)	orthophosphoric acid (85 %)	47 ml


Note: for the preparation of the staining solution, the sequential addition of the components in the following order has to be maintained:

1. first dissolve aluminum sulfate in Milli-Q water
2. thereafter add ethanol, homogenize, and mix CBB G-250 to the solution
3. as recently as the solution is completely dissolved, add phosphoric acid (the incorporation of the acid to the alcoholic media lets the Coomassie molecules aggregate into their colloidal state)
4. finally fill up with Milli-Q water
