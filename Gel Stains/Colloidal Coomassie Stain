Reagents:

Coomassie solution:	Final Volume to 2000 ml H2O
0.02 % (w/v)	0.4g Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250
5 % (w/v)	100g aluminum sulfate-(14-18)-hydrate
10 % (v/v)	200ml ethanol (96%)
2 % (v/v)	47ml orthophosphoric acid (85 %)


Important: The order of addition of the components in the following list must be maintained:

1. Dissolve aluminum sulfate in Milli-Q water.
2. Add ethanol and mix.
3. Add CBB G-250 to the solution.  Stir until CBB G-250 is dissolved.
3. Add phosphoric acid (the addition of the acid to the alcoholic media lets the Coomassie molecules aggregate into their colloidal state).
4. Bring to final volume with Milli-Q water.
