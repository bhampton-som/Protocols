## Procedure for making sol-gel frits in fused silica capillary tubing

### Materials

Kasil-1
Formamide, High purity

### Procedure
1. Add 300ul of Kasil-1 to a 1.5ml snap cap tube.
2. Add 100ul of Formamide.
3. Vortex.
4. Briefly dip a fused silica capillary into the tube to draw the Kasil material in to about 5mm or less distance.
5. Heat the capillary horizontally at 100C for at least 60min.
6. Cut the end of the tubing to leave about 1mm of the solidified sol-gel frit in place.  Then polish the end to effect a smooth flat surface suitable for a butt joint to an emitter.
